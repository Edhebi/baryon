Baryon
======

**Note:** This engine will probably never be mature enough to be use in anything
concrete and the name "baryon" seems reasonable for a lot of different stuff.
If someone has a real project and want to use that crate name, I'm willing to
give it over. Just send me a ping at `lmasson@edhebi.info`.
